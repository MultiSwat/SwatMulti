		<h2><b>Welcome to our site!</b></h2>
		<p>Multi is a community for people who self-identify with some multi heritage, such as multiracial, multiethnic, multicultural, multireligious, and/or transracial and transnational adoptees. Multi supports the exploration and navigation of multiple identities that are unaddressed or marginalized in mainstream society. We aim to create a close-knit community in which intersectionality and the complexities of multi-ness are celebrated and explored; this space is necessary at Swarthmore College and in the world. We will share our stories, take in multimedia and literature, and engage in discussions. Multi is for those looking for a home-base community at Swarthmore, as well as those looking for a bridge to other cultural groups; it is for those who have thought a lot about their identity as well as those just beginning to. With regular meetings, discussions, and special events we hope to foster new relationships and create a safe community that emphasizes belongingness and interconnectedness among community members.</p>
